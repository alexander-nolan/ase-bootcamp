# Part 6: Network Isolation for Azure Key Vault

## **Introduction**
Network isolation is crucial for securing Azure Key Vault by restricting access to specific virtual networks and IP addresses. This ensures that only authorized resources can access your Key Vault, reducing the risk of unauthorized data access.

## **Steps to Implement Network Isolation**

### **1. Disable Access from Public Networks**

Disabling public network access helps prevent any unauthorized access attempts from outside your designated network.

**Disable Public Network Access:**
- Go to your Key Vault in the Azure Portal.
- Navigate to the **Networking** section.
- Remove public access.

*Note: After making this change, all public access to your Key Vault will be blocked.*

**Test Access Restrictions:**
- Attempt to access Key Vault resources, such as secrets or certificates, from a public network.
- Verify that access is denied.

### **2. Enable Public Network Access with Restrictions**

If you need limited public access, you can configure the Key Vault to allow only specific IP addresses.

**Get Your Public IP Address:**
- Retrieve your public IP address.
- Record the IP address for use in the next step.

**Enable Public Network Access with Restrictions:**
- Enable public network access on your Key Vault.
- Set the network configuration to allow only your recorded IP address.
- Save the changes.

**Verify Configuration:**
- Access the Key Vault from your allowed IP address.
- Check in the Azure Portal under the **Networking** section to see your IP listed with a status of **Allow**.

### **3. Deleting the Key Vault**

Deleting a Key Vault can sometimes generate errors. Follow these steps to troubleshoot:

**Attempt to Delete the Key Vault:**
- Try deleting the Key Vault through the Azure Portal or Azure CLI.

**Troubleshoot Deletion Errors:**
- If you encounter errors, review the errors generated and determine the reason for failure.
- Make necessary adjustments.
- Delete the Key Vault.
