# Part 7: Creating Key Vault with Terraform

## **Introduction**
In this part, you'll learn how to automate the creation and management of Azure Key Vault using Terraform. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC), you can ensure consistent, repeatable deployments across your environments.

## **Terraform Installation**

```bash
choco install terraform
```

**Note:** If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can follow the instructions at chocolatey.org/install.

## **Setup and Configuration**

### **1. Configure Backend Storage**
Create an Azure Storage Account to store the Terraform state file. This ensures that your state is maintained centrally and can be shared among multiple collaborators.

### **2. Create the Key Vault Resource**
Use the `azurerm_key_vault` resource in Terraform to define your Key Vault. This resource should include specifications like name, resource group and location.

*Hint: Define RBAC roles and assignments to manage permissions for different users and services.*

### **3. Enable Purge Protection**
Once the Key Vault is created, enable Purge Protection using your existing Terraform configuration. This feature prevents permanent deletion of the Key Vault or its contents, adding an extra layer of security.

### **4. Optional: Create Certificates, Secrets, and Keys**
Optionally, use Terraform to create and manage certificates, secrets, and keys in your Key Vault. This enables centralized management of sensitive information in your infrastructure.


### Lab Completion

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the lab. You have learned how to:

- Set up and configure Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage sensitive information.
- Implement and manage role-based access control (RBAC) to control permissions for Key Vault resources.
- Use Terraform to automate the creation and configuration of Key Vaults, including enabling features like purge protection.
- Create and manage secrets, certificates, and keys within Key Vault.
- Secure access to Key Vault by enabling network isolation and restricting access to specific virtual networks and IP addresses.
